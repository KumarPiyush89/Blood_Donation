            <h1><b>Blood Donation Tips</b></h1><br />
            <p>If you plan to give blood, follow these steps:</p>
            <h4><b>&bull; Drink plenty of water.</b>
                Staying hydrated makes it easier to find your veins and prevents you from becoming light-headed
                after donating, Dr. Vossoughi says.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4><b>&bull; Eat well beforehand. </b>
                Don’t skip breakfast, and be sure to eat snacks offered to you. “These things will help you tolerate
                the donation well and feel like yourself the rest of the day,” she says.
            </h4>
            <br />
            <h4><b>&bull; Exercise before donating blood, not afterward.</b>
                It’s OK to go to the gym before you donate blood but not so wise afterward. “We don’t want people
                getting dizzy,” Dr. Vossoughi says. “You’ve basically done your workout for the day once you’ve
                donated blood.”
            </h4>
            <br />
            <h4><b>&bull; Take iron tablets.</b>
                The American Red Cross recommends that individuals who donate blood frequently take an iron
                supplement or a multivitamin with iron. “More and more, we’re recommending that teenage donors in
                particular take iron, because it’s been shown that teenage donors may become iron deficient after
                blood donation,” Dr. DeSimone says.
